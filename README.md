- 👋 Hi, I’m Tarcísio Fonseca Teles (@teles-tarcisio)
- 👀 I’m interested in Engineering, Embedded Devices/Electronics, IoT, Cloud Computing, Web Services, Linux, Electric Vehicles, Bicycles, Motorbikes, Running, Coffee and some more things in the professional and personal areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I started (in 2021-10) a 9-month bootcamp made by "Driven Education" (a company from "Responde Aí" group), so I can become a Fullstack Web Developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technologies that are useful in our day-by-day lives,
    and maybe even working with Electric Vehicles applications/integrations/hardware.
